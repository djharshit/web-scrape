Suraj Gupta,20 May 2020,"I'm a full time Developer and I needed a bigger screen because staring at small texts all day long on a 15inch screen is not good enough and it strains my eyes.Earlier i was considering 24inch of the same model but the price difference was of 4k INR and i did not find it worth but still i had doubts in my mind that whether i made a mistake or what. But once i got this product and i set it up, I'm telling you guyz, it is just awesome and for programmers I don't think that 4k is worth. That 2 inch difference is not something that you could notice. Infact, after using this 22 inch monitor, i think 1080 is the best resolution, and going 24 or 27 is overkill and you could see the pixels in the screen. So, if you are buying a FHD monitor, 22 inch is the best size you should go for, 24 and 27 inch is best for 1440 resolution.Not only for programmers, if you a media consumer then this is a great choice at this price.You should go for this product."
RAJAT,1 July 2020,"Pixelated text and fonts cause headache while working or browsing. The system settings and menu is also pixelated, so it's not the issue with specific operating system. I tried connecting with windows, linux and Mac but pixelated overall appearance in all. HD videos appear good, without issues but I mostly work with text while coding and browsing, so it's waste of money for me. I trusted LG after reading lot of good reviews but no-one pointed this pixelation and blurry text/fonts issue. I hope my review helps others to make informed choice"
Bhavna Shetty,19 June 2020,I was misguided to buy it saying it's made in india. Once I received it I got to know its actual china made. Had it keep it as it was not returnable.  Amazon please mention where the product is made.
Vaibhav,14 February 2021,"The overall picture quality is quite good. Look and feel of the monitor is also good. It has a good level of brightness and contrast range. I use it for my job and spend more than 10 hours per day using it. But I don't feel any strain on my eyes. The height of the stand is perfect for me.However, there are two issues:1. There is some light bleeding (see photo)2. Speaker quality is very badAlthough I didn't expect the speakers to be of great quality, it still disappointed me for how bad they sound.But it has an audio port, so it should be ok. I haven't tried the audio port sound though.If you are ok with these two issues, you can go ahead with this one."
Rohit Kulegi,30 May 2020,"I just bought this monitor, and I know that this can run at 75hz of refresh rate, so I changed the refresh rate to the 75hz, and then I saw these wired green lines and screen trearing thing this only happened when I am running the monitor in 75hz settings, and when I dropped the refresh rate to again 60hz it becomes normal, and there will be no issues then, I am using it with my i3, 8th gen Lenovo Laptop with no dedicated GPU. I don't know why this is happening, maybe my monitor has some issues, if anyone is facing the same issue, please reply or otherwise I have to replace this one."
Tj,4 July 2021,"The MRP as per the product detail is Rs.18,000. The MRP affixed on the carton of the monitor is Rs.13,900. which is less the price actually charged in the website Rs.13,999. The Snap of MRP sticker on the carton of the monitor is attached."
Kaushik Sajjan Agarwal,17 January 2021,"I had done quite a research before I bought this monitor and if you believe me this is the best monitor in this price range...Cost varies from 11K to 11.5K, features and design are obviously mentioned in the product description and each of them stands true.The speakers are good. I checked and there is no backlight bleed in my monitor...The look kills it and it's worth every penny you buy it for..."
SYED WASEEM AHMED,27 October 2020,Colors are very accurate!I can also adjust the sharpness which will make things even sharper and clear.:::VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:::To get the best Picture experience you have to change some of the settings. As the factory settings are verybad-Keep the contrast to 50 and brightness to 80 or 90-Keep the BLACK level to LOW OR OFF this will give you a washed out effect if you keep it High don't use it.-Set the Picture Quality to WarmCheck the 2nd pic for more info try to keep it same as mine.
